## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?  
  That a closed mindset can be confused for imposter syndrom.  
  That growth mindset is not always a daily practice but can be a corrective when you feel you are stuck or struggling.  
2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?  
I'm going to be honest and say the concept of Growth Mindset doesn't really resonate with me because it seems kind of obvious. Of course there's still more for me to learn
about coding. There's more for me to learn about everything. That's not to say I'm a perfect learner or something just that the ways I block myself off from learning don't
really match up with growth mindset or the lack thereof and are more a tendency to want to skip ahead because I think I've "got" a concept that could use more practice or a kind of
dismisive attitude that certain things aren't worth learning. "Well yes I COULD learn the complete lineup of the 1978 Mets but...why?"  
3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?  
I'm now worried I missed something about the instructions because I really didn't notice a huge change here. All the directions that were left out were things that were covered previously and the directions still seemed pretty clear and direct.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.  
It's a statement that runs under certain conditions. If we're out of eggs go to the store and get more eggs. If I've done four pomodoros in a row my pomodoro app gives a longer break than normal.  
5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.  
You essentially run all the conditionals one after another and the program reads them that way. It evaluates the first condition and if it's true acts on that and if not it evaluates the next condition until it gets to an "else" statement or the conditionals stop.  

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?  
Now you're talking logical operators. You can use && to check if multiple conditions are all true and || to check if any of several conditions are true.  

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
I guess I'm wondering about nesting if statements or what happens if in more complex programs you are attaching multiple if statement trees to the same variable. (Multiple parts of gitHub might want to run checks on someone's username for instance.) Is there a way or organizing that or is it still just "whatever's first in the code evaluates first" even with multiple if statements.
